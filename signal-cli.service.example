Description=signal-cli Daemon Service
# Start after the network is available
After=network.target

[Service]
# It is STRONGLY recommended to run signal-cli as its own dedicated, non-privileged user.
# Replace 'signal-cli-user' and 'signal-cli-group' accordingly.
User=signal-cli-user
Group=signal-cli-group

# WorkingDirectory is usually not critical for signal-cli daemon, 
# but can be set to the user's home or a dedicated directory.
# WorkingDirectory=/home/signal-cli-user

# IMPORTANT: Adjust paths for your Ubuntu server installation!
# - Replace '/PATH_TO_YOUR/signal-cli' with the actual path to the signal-cli executable.
#   (e.g., /usr/local/bin/signal-cli or /opt/signal-cli/bin/signal-cli)
# - Replace '/PATH_TO_YOUR_SIGNAL_CONFIG_DIR' with your signal-cli config/data directory.
#   (e.g., /home/signal-cli-user/.config/signal-cli, /etc/signal-cli/data, or /opt/signal-cli/data)
# - Replace '+YOUR_SIGNAL_NUMBER' with your actual registered signal number (e.g. +4915678470953)
ExecStart=/PATH_TO_YOUR/signal-cli --config /PATH_TO_YOUR_SIGNAL_CONFIG_DIR -u +YOUR_SIGNAL_NUMBER daemon --tcp 0.0.0.0:7446

# If signal-cli takes a long time to start, you might increase the timeout
