            Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data 
            comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration

          </p>
          <p>
            We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail 
            communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data 
            against third-party access.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others 
            makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.,

          <h3>Storage duration</h3>
          <p>
            Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal 
            data will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you 
            assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will 
            be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data 
            (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place 
            after these reasons cease to apply.
          </p>

          <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
          <p>
            A wide range of data processing operations are possible only with your express consent. You can 
            also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice 
            to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you 
              have the right to at any time object to the processing of your personal data based on grounds 
              arising from your unique situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these 
              provisions. To determine the legal basis for which any processing of data is based on, please 
              consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we will no longer process 
              your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection 
              worthy grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if 
              the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal claims 
              (objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR).
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have 
              the right to at any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the 
              purposes of such advertising. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is 
              affiliated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently 
              no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 2 GDPR).
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
          <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a 
            supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, 
            place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint 
            is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis 
            of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a 
            commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to 
            another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
          </p>

          <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
          <p>
            Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand 
            information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose 
            of the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. 
            If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please 
            do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your 
            personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand 
            restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will 
              usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is 
              ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the 
              option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the 
              eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>
              If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim 
              legal rights, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal 
              data instead of its eradication.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights 
              will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined which 
              interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your 
              personal data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data โ with the exception of 
            their archiving โ may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend 
            legal rights or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important 
            public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.
          </p>

          <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
          <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase 
            orders or inquiries you submit to us as the site operator, this site uses either an SSL or a 
            TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address 
            line of the browser switches from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and also by the appearance of the lock 
            icon in the browser line.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, third parties cannot read the data you transmit to us.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>

          <h3>Server log files</h3>
          <p>

          <p>
            This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator of the website 
            has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the 
            operator&apos;s website. In order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.
