          <h2>Consumer Dispute Resolution/Universal Arbitration Board</h2>
          <p>
            We are not willing or obligated to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a 
            consumer arbitration board.
          </p>

          <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
          <p>
            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with 
            § 7 para. 1 TMG under general law. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider 
            are not under any obligation to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to 
            investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. 
            However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which knowledge of 
            a specific infringement becomes known. Upon becoming aware of corresponding infringements, we 
            will remove this content immediately.
          </p>

          <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
          <p>
            Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. 
            Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or 
            operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages 
            were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not 
            recognizable at the time of linking.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete 
            evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links 
            immediately.
          </p>
