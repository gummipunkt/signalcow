[Service]
# Replace 'your-user' and 'your-group' with the actual user and group
# that should run this service. It's highly recommended NOT to use root.
User=your-user
Group=your-group

# Replace with the actual path to your frontend's root directory on the server

# Ensure you have a production build (e.g., 'npm run build' or 'next build')
# The command to start your frontend. Adjust if necessary.
# For Next.js, this is typically 'next start -p YOUR_FRONTEND_PORT'
# Replace YOUR_FRONTEND_PORT with the port your frontend should run on (e.g., 3000)
# Make sure the path to 'node' and 'next' (or 'npm') are correct for your server environment.
# Example for Next.js:
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node node_modules/.bin/next start
# Example for a typical Node.js app using npm start:
# ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start

Restart=on-failure
# Set environment variables, NODE_ENV=production is crucial for performance
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
# Add other environment variables your frontend might need
# Environment="API_URL=http://localhost:YOUR_BACKEND_PORT"
